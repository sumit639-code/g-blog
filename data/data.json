Working on Pact may cover many areas, including but limited to:\n• Parsing\n• Evaluation\n• LSP\n• Formal Verification\n• Database Integration\n• Gas Accounting\n\nWhat Sets You Apart\n\nWe don’t believe in hard and fast hiring criteria because great candidates can come from all backgrounds, but here are some attributes that we frequently find useful for the kinds of engineering problems that we work on:\n• Self-starters who prioritize delivering working software solutions to real-world problems and are comfortable with aggressively prioritizing and cutting out distractions to achieve the biggest impact amidst competing concerns.\n• Several years of commercial software experience with Haskell or other functional languages is a significant plus.\n• Strong working knowledge of distributed systems and networking is a plus.\n• Experience designing and implementing production DSLs.\n• Ability to collaborate cross-functionally with other teams responsible for client interactions, DevOps & monitoring, etc.\n\nKadena is a remote-first company, with the ability to work throughout the world.
